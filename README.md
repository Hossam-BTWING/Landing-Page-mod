# Landing Page Project-mod

## Modifications according to the tutors reviews: (there were 3 comments)
* I made the website responsive across all screens as per request.
* When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section (done) and I removed the smooth scroll from CSS ... now its only done by using JS scrollIntoView() function as per request
* Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting. (I tried my best).
